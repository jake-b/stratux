RA835AI Rasberry Pi "HAT" for Stratux 
=====================================

This is a really rough draft of a "HAT" (Hardware Attached on Top) to connect
a RA835AI to the Rasberry Pi for use primarily with Stratux.

Currently it is just  a starting point.  Some things yet to work out:

- Is it connected correctly?
- Is FSYNC supposed to be grounded?  Data sheet says yes; forums leave doubt.
- Pull-ups for I2C?
- Decoupling/filtering the power lines?

I tried by best to keep the ground planes clear of traces so that hopefully
it shields the GPS module from the Pi processor underneith.

This uses a custom library for the RA835AI, and a contributed library from
www.cadsoftusa.com "raspberrypi_bastelstube_v13" for the Pi GPIO connector
and board layout.
